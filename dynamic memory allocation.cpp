pointer - variable = new data-type
//Pointer intitialised with NULL
int *p = NULL

p = new int;
/ Combine declaration of pointer 
// and their assignment
int *p = new int; 
Initialize memory: We can also initialize the memory using new operator:
pointer-variable = new data-type(value);
Example:
int *p = new int(25);
float *q = new float(75.25);
Allocate block of memory: new operator is also used to allocate a block(an array) of memory of type data-type.
pointer-variable = new data-type[size];
